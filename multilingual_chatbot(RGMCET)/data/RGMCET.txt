Course Name : Computer Science & Engineering (Data Science)
Data science has become important due to recent technology disruptions. Most fundamental is Moore's Law which has driven an exponential growth in computing, storage, and communications per rupee over the past 50 years. This rate of growth shows no signs of abating. Consequently, today we have the Internet of Things: a plethora of sensors costing 10s of rupees or less, a global Internet with almost limitless bandwidth, and enormous storage in global clouds. The present era is full of technological advances in almost all spectrum of life and we are flooded with enormous amount of data. There is an increasing demand of capturing, analysing, and synthesizing this large amount of data sets in a number of application domains to better understand various phenomena and to convert the information available in the data into actionable strategies such as new scientific discoveries, business applications, policy making, and healthcare etc.Data science is the area where applications of various tools and techniques from the disciplines of applied statistics, mathematics and computer science are used to get greater insight and to make better and informed decisions for various purposes by analysing a large amount of data. Jim Gray, database pioneer, has called Data Science the 4th paradigm of science. The first 3 are the empirical, the theoretical and the computational paradigms. In industry there is an escalating demand for trained professionals who can collect, process, and study the large data sets and reveal underlying trend and other insights. Consequently, the study of data science as a discipline has become essential to cater the growing need for professionals and researchers to deal with the future challenges.Given the mounting importance of the data science paradigm, RGMCET has decided to start a new 4 years bachelor program on Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization Data Science. The curriculum of the this program focuses on exposing to the students with the essentials of applied statistics, applied mathematics, and computer science required in the context of data science and its applications with strong emphasis on having hands-on experience with the help of practicum, labs and experience of dealing with real-world problems.

The institute attracts the cream of student community from across the country through national level competitive examinations and interviews. It believes that the true potential of such students cannot be realized through academics alone. The students are provided with opportunities for exploring and enhancing their talents in extra- curricular activities through Literary, Cultural and Sports clubs. This helps to promote self- management skills and core values in the students, all of which cumulatively help to groom the students into integrated personalities.The students are involved in a host of other activities. All major events like youth festivals; technical competitions are actively organized and conducted by the student body. There is student representation on various administrative committees like Hostel Governing Body, Canteen Committee, Course Monitoring, Discipline Committee etc. All Student committees function under the peripheral supervision of faculty.

Alumni Activities

As we inspire our students, sometimes they repay us in full measure. The alumni plays varied roles in the wider society and many of them hold key positions of influence which direct the development of society in one way or the other. This way the alumni giving amazing support to the alma matter has resulted in :

Guest Lectures and Training :
To the students where the alumni have visited and shared their rich and inspiring experiences creating awareness amongst them about the competitive world outside the campus. They not only are mentors or speakers but every single act of giving, no matter how big or small it seems definitely supports the institution.

Student Placements and Internships :
The connect and coordination between the T & P cell and the Alumni is resulting in the creation of a goodwill about the campus in the minds of the employers and thus they are providing their whole hearted support as recruiters or interviewers assisting with admission interviews or placements or as a donor or sponsor supporting student learning opportunities in enhancing the rate of Campus Recruitments and internships too.

Alumni Meetings / Reunions :
Alumni reunions are welcomed by some and dreaded by others. Either way a planned reunion can be a lot of fun and those who dreaded coming would also make it. Every year, the Alumni meets committee is responsible for holding such meets in the metropolitan cities like Hyderabad, Bengaluru etc . These are one such gatherings where all the alumni are basked in this happy moment and proud to have their family and friends watching them. Such appreciation event is also complemented by presenting specially designed appreciation certificate and a souvenir quoting the developments happened so far. This would not have been possible without the active participation of our alumni which the institution would heartily thank them for.
